For each 'test...' file:
	- energy increases down each column
	- phase increases along each row

For unbinned, the monochromatic fluxes are evaluated at the bin centres in both
energy and phase. For test 1, light-curves are also shown in the figures at 
low-resolution using a different integration algorithm (observer-to-star/
image-plane-to-star, whereby the image plane is discretised into a mesh of 
pixels, instead of discretising the photosphere into a mesh of 'cells'); this
is merely an internal check. The units are photons/cm^2/s/keV.

For binned, the fluxes are integrated over both energy and phase, and scaled by
the total number of rotations during an exposure time of 1e6 seconds, given a 
spin of 0.001 Hz --> i.e. x1000. The units are photons/cm^2.

The temperatures: temp1 = logT 5.69; temp2 = logT 6.05; temp3 = logT 6.30

Update: spurious factor of local comoving photon energy removed. Initially,
	it was incorrectly assumed that the tabulated intensity was in
	photons, not ergs.

	Differences...

	- The overall normalisaation of the light curves changes in an
	  energy-dependent manner.

	- The fractional differences between atmospheres are effectively invariant
	  for the unbinned light curves (the relativistic boosting is coordinate
	  dependent, so no perfect cancellation between light curves, but, luckily,
	  very slow spin so boost factor everywhere ~unity; the gravitational
	  redshift is effectively constant too, given the spin).

	- The fractional differences change very slightly for the binned light
	  curves because of the photon energy dependence, but this is negligible.

	--> Conclusions regarding sensitivity to atmosphere code/composition
		unchanged.
