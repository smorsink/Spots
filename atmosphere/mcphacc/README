These are Cole's McPHAC intensity files. Their energy grid have been reduced by 1 in log scale (reduced by factor of 10)
from the original files, since there might have been a mistake in the original energy grid. 
Log(temperature) goes from 5.1 to 6.5 in steps of 0.05, and log(gravity) goes from 13.7 to 14.7 in steps of 0.1.
For 3rd temperature and 4th gravity choice, the name is "mcphacc_T3_g4.txt".
Column 1 is energy of the photon; column 2 is angle to normal; column 3 is intensity/(T^3) in cgs values.
